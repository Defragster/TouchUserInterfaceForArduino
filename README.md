# Touch User Interface for Arduino

This library is a simple touchscreen user interface for building Arduino applications.  Adding buttons and menus to your sketch is as-easy-as filling in a table.  The library also includes many functions for displaying your own data.  This library requires an Arduino 32 bit processor and a 320x240 ILI9341 LCD touch screen display .
